# QR-CODE

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The challenge is to build out a QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools I like to help me complete the challenge. So if I've got something I'd like to practice, I am allowed to give it a go.

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the challenge folder. The design will be for both a mobile and a desktop versions.

Your comments are highly welcomed.
Thank you.
